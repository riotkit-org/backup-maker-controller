# generate the code with:
# --output-base    because this script should also be able to run inside the vendor dir of
#                  k8s.io/kubernetes. The output-base is needed for the generators to output into the vendor dir
#                  instead of the $GOPATH directly. For normal projects this can be dropped.
# This generates deepcopy,client,informer and lister for the resource package (v1alpha1)
# This is separate from the pipeline package as resource are staying in v1alpha1 and they
# need to be separated (at least in terms of go package) from the pipeline's packages to
# not having dependency cycle.
